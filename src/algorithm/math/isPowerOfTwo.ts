   * Powers of two in binary look like this:
   * 1: 0001
   * 2: 0010
   * 4: 0100
   * 8: 1000
   *
   * Note that there is always exactly 1 bit set. The only exception is with a signed integer.
   * e.g. An 8-bit signed integer with a value of -128 looks like:
   * 10000000
   *
   * So after checking that the number is greater than zero, we can use a clever little bit
   * hack to test that one and only one bit is set.
